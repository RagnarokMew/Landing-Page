As an ambitious man with his eyes on the crown, he is the brain behind the Mewnium Cryptocurrency and Algorithm, as well as all related projects. Without him, nothing would have worked and dust would have remained dust, not gold.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="f1 pad30 small-600 smallh quote">Dust to dust, ashes to ashes, eventually everything returns to nothingness. A thought I always had and believed. I've always wanted to prove it wrong, to create something eternal, something that retains or increases in value, something that can withstand the sands of time. This is what Mewnium represents at its core level. Reliability, Dependability and Consistency, my own personal pillars.</div>

That's the first stage of crypto, my job which I could say was achieved. After that, the second stagte is actually making everything work in the backdoors. That was the job of the rest of the team and if I hadn't seen it for myself I would have never believed it had happened.</div>
