Part of the Odin Project Curriculum
## About
As this project on the Odin Project grants more creative freedom (being provided only with the website design), I decided to use this liberty in order to poke fun at the crypto scams/rug-pulls, but also those that believe blindly in this tech, or are just speculative investors that want to manipulate unknowledgeable peeps into investing and losing their money in order to make a quick buck.
### Mewnium (MwM)
As such, the project will present Mewnium (MwM), the imaginary cryptocurrecy, that is the next Bitcoin (source: trust me bro). It is inspired by the Pokemon Mew#0151 (not an NFT, but this gives me an idea), from which my tag at this time (RagnarokMew) derives (don't tell Nintendo).
### Mewtaverse
Imaginary NFT project. I kinda lack ideas for this but it needs to exist for the navigation bar. Gotta give props for the name.
## Goal
As this is the last project of the chapter of Flexbox and CSS, this project will represent the epitome of everything I've studied to this point.
This project will prove:
* Understanding of (basic) HTML
* Understanding of (basic) CSS
* Understanding of Flexbox and Alignment
## What was achieved
* Using Flex in order to align content correctly on multiple screen sizes
* Learned to use multiple backgrounds (though no longer used in project or any commits)
* Learned to make curved corners (just wanted to mentioned this)
* Understood how to write better CSS classes (though was not applioed to a great extent)
* Learned how formatting input works
* Got accustomed to how a website should look
* Grasp a basic relation between colours on a website
## Credits
Due to being the largest project I have undertaken up to this point, I need to use free-to-use images along my own and as such whether required or not I will give credit to the creator below.
